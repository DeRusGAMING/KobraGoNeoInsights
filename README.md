**Hi and welcome to my little page about the Anycubic Kobra Go and Kobra Neo.**  
  
As a 3D printing newbie, I received a **Kobra Neo** from a friend that needed some tinkering and fixing. After struggling to find specific information and tips for the 
Neo, which is relatively new to the Kobra family. I was trying to find informations and tips specifically about the **Neo** - it turned out that it wasn't an easy
mission as it's pretty new to the Kobra family. I decided to document my experience and collect information and tips for the **Go** and **Neo** (as they are basically
the same). I hope this helps other newbies get started with these devices more easily.

If you'd like to contribute, please let me know. I'm especially looking for content related to the Go as I don't have any yet. If you can provide certain pictures or other information, it would be very helpful. You don't need a GitHub account to contribute; just send me an email at 3dneo@quantentunnel.de, and we'll figure something out.
  
*I hope you'll find some useful informations around here - so: happy tinkering and printing!*
