link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The X-axis of both the <strong>Go</strong> and the <strong>Neo</strong> is belt driven (6mm wide), the motor which drives the belt (6mm wide) is located at the left side. <br> You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the right side of the aluminum profile where the printhead is guided onto. </p> <p><img alt="X-axis knob" src=../../assets/images/x-axis_knob_web.jpg></p> <h3 id=belt-tension>Belt Tension<a class=headerlink href=#belt-tension title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that. Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft - if it's too loose though, the belt might slip. If you can 'bend' the belt down a bit by putting a some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel an amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. If you pluck it like a guitar string then it should make something like a mid to high sound. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Belt Maintenance</summary> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks at the belt. </li> <li>Check the gear wheels of the motors which are driving the belts. Are they also looking ok? Did they become loose on the motor shaft somehow? </li> </ul> </details> <h3 id=v-slot-wheels-position>V-Slot Wheels Position<a class=headerlink href=#v-slot-wheels-position title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The wheels are leading the printhead onto the aluminum profile of the x-axis. They are mounted onto a metal plate where the printhead itself is mounted onto. The wheels run in the V-slot of the profile and therefore they should sit in a good position. <br> You can adjust the roller tension by turning the eccentric nut which moves the wheels either towards or away from the aluminum profile. </p> <details class=tip> <summary>Adjusting the Position of the V-Slot Wheels</summary> <ul> <li>The wheels shouldn't sit too tight in the V-slot but also not too loose. They should touch the aluminum profile and sit in there pretty tight, but they should be able to roll and move freely - so they shouldn't sit too tight though (sorry, it's kinda hard to explain). On the other hand, they also shouldn't be too loose or far away from the profile which would lead to instability.

You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the front side of the aluminum profile where the bed is guided onto.

Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft - if it's too loose though, the belt might slip. If you can 'bend' the belt down a bit by putting some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel an amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. If you pluck it like a guitar string then it should make something like a mid to high sound. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Belt Maintenance</summary> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks at the belt. </li> <li>Check the gear wheels of the motors which are driving the belts.

They run in the V-slot of the long profile in the middle underneath the bed and therefore they should sit in a good position. Means, they shouldn't sit too tight in the V-slot but also not too loose - they should be able to roll and move freely, but they shouldn't be too far away from the profile which would lead to instability.<br> You can adjust the roller tension by turning the eccentric nut which moves the wheels either towards or away from the aluminum profile.

Not only sideways/horizontally, but also up and down/vertically. If so, not only check the v-slot wheels and maybe adjust their fitting using the eccentric nuts, also check if the screws of the gantry of the bed where the wheels are mounted to are tightened up.

The lead screw has 8mm in diameter with 8mm lead ('distance' of one complete rotation) and 2mm pitch and has a length of 350mm (it's actually this kind of lead screw which is used pretty much everywhere in these kind of machines).<br> This rod is mounted to the 5mm shaft of the motor by a coupler at the bottom. The top end of the rod is completely unguided, in between it's guided and secured by a POM anti-backlash nut which you can see at the following picture, it's the black plastic part mounted to the black steel bracket. </p> <p><img alt="Z-axis views" src=../../assets/images/z-axis_neo_web.jpg></p> <details class=example> <summary>Lead Screw Maintenance</summary> <ul> <li>Make sure the coupler is mounted correctly and the screws are tightened. Check from time to time that the coupler didn't come loose somehow. </li> <li>Make sure the rod is clean, there shouldn't stick debris or dirt on it as it could/would block the movement. </li> <li>If you need to clean it, it's advisable to disassamble the whole rod system including the coupler and the anti-backlash nut. A detailed instruction with images about how to do so will come soon. </li> <li>Spray e.g. WD-40 on the rod to loosen old sticky oil and debris. Then take a toothbrush or something like that for being able to reach the bottom of the thread also and clean it up. Make sure to not leave any particles from the anti-backlash nut or any dirt stuck on it. </li> <li>After this procedure, clean the WD-40 off of the rod by using e.g. car break cleaner or silicone remover spray. It'll wash off everything, you can also use an old cloth to wipe it (but make sure that no textile fibres will stick in the thread somehow). </li> <li>After you cleaned and dried it, inspect it! Are there any dents in the thread or any kind of deformation that shouldn't be there? If so, it would be best to get a new lead screw and replace it. </li> <li>If everything is fine though and you want to mount the lead screw to the printer again, add a little lube to the rod. Don't be excessive here and drown it with oil - just use a tiny bit to make it glide better.<br> <em>Don't use WD-40 or grease which contains graphite or MoS2!</em> <br> I personally like to use PTFE spray first, let it dry and then put some synthetic lube on which is made for mountainbike chains as it uses to stick a bit better onto the metal. But every good medium to heavy synthetic machine oil will do the job just fine.<br> You can draw a line of oil all along one side of the rod from the bottom to the top and then put the rod between your fingers and turn it. By doing so, the excessive oil will build up at your fingers and will also reach the bottom of the rod. Wipe off any excessive amount of oil afterwards again - you don't want to have oil dripping down on your motor later!<br> Tip: to avoid dripping oil down to the motor, I personally wrap a pipe cleaner around the rod right above the coupler. If by time a drop or two will move down, the pipe cleaner will absorb it. </li> <li>Before installing the rod into the coupler of the motor again, clean the last inch of the bottom again by using the car break cleaner and the cloth. Try to get it as much degreased as possible, so that it doesn't start to slip inside of the coupler later. </li> <li>When you're done reassembling everything and you home the printhead, you only should hear the low noise of the turning motor now - so now grinding noise from the anti-backlash nut or something like that. </li> </ul> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Don't Use WD-40 for Lubrication</p> <p>Do yourself a favour and <em>never</em> use WD-40 for <em>lubrication</em> as it's <em>not</em> a lubricant!<br> It's perfectly fine for washing off old oil from the threaded rod, but it's <em>not</em> a sufficient lubrification!<br> People use to think WD-40 is the perfect solution for pretty much everything, but they aren't aware of the fact that -due to the chemical recipe it's made of- it's absolutely not sufficient for getting parts lubed mid- to longterm.

So if they aren't in a perfect vertical alignment, it will result in shear forces, increased wear of the anti-backlash nut and even may cause jamming.<br> If you want to change the coupler, you'll need to get a coupler which suits &#8541;mm as the motor shaft is 5mm and the rod is 8mm in diameter. Make sure you <em>don't</em> get a coupler which uses a grub screw that holds onto the shaft and rod itself, you need to get a coupler which uses some kind of a clamp mechanism so to say as the stock one. The reason is simple: the motor shaft is round, it doesn't have a flat area where a grub screw needs to be screwn onto. Same goes for the lead screw itself. (Pictures are about to come soon.) </p> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Changing the Anti-Backlash Nut</summary> <p>If the anti-backlash nut that came with the printer is worn out, you don't necessarily have to buy the original spare part. Actually I personally would refuse to so so anyway because I personally don't really like the material of it and prefer brass nuts. Just make sure you get the right size and check the top of the nut which is mounted to the holder to make sure you'll get the right ones. (Pictures are about to come soon.)<br> When you (re-)install the anti-backlash nut (whichever you get), make sure that you press both parts together when putting the lead screw in. There's a little spring between the upper and the lower part of the nut which is there to prevent the backlash. This spring needs to be pushed together during the installation, so that there's tension and both parts of that nut system are being pushed away from each other when installed. </p> </details> <h3 id=v-slot-wheels-position_2>V-Slot Wheels Position<a class=headerlink href=#v-slot-wheels-position_2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The wheels are leading the x-axis gantry along the z-axis aluminum profile. They run in the V-slot of the z-axis profiles and therefore they should sit in a good position. Means, they shouldn't sit too tight in the V-slot but also not too loose - they should be able to roll and move freely, but they shouldn't be too far away from the profile which would lead to instability.<br> You can adjust the roller tension by turning the eccentric nut of the wheel which moves the wheels either towards or away from the aluminum profile. Not all of the wheels have eccentric nuts though as the following picture shows, only the two wheels (one at each side) which are facing the inner side (towards the bed) do have an eccentric nut. </p> <p><img alt src=../../assets/images/x-axis_left-side-nut_web.jpg></p> <p><img alt src=../../assets/images/x-axis_knob_nut_web.jpg></p> <details class=example> <summary>Adjusting the Wheels: Special 'Trick'</summary> <p>However, you might face the problem that you just can't get all of the three wheels at each side to touch the aluminum frame as they should. So if you need to adjust the position of the wheels using the eccentric nuts, you might encouter the problem that e.g. the inner wheel and the lower wheel on the outside may sit in the v-slot really nice, but that the third wheel (the upper one on the outside in this example) isn't even touching the aluminum and can be spinned in the air. Whatever you'll try with the eccentric nut of the wheel of the inside (because there's only this one), you won't be able to achieve that all of the three wheels touch the aluminum and sit in the slot like they should.<br> So - what to do?<br> Well, there's a trick: you have to loosen the two hexagon socket screws which are holding the Y-shaped metal plate (where the wheels are mounted onto, at the backside so to say) against the aluminum frame of the x-axis gantry. Dont take them out (!), just loosen them a bit. Then you can adjust the position of the wheels by using the eccentric nut again because now the metal plate can move a bit and you can adjust it's position towards the aluminum frame of the x-axis gantry.<br> It's even better to drive up the x-axis gantry all the way to the top first and secure it with some zipties or velcros. Then lower the gantry again until the weight is held by the zipties (make sure the distance between the x-axis and the upper plastic x-frame is pretty much the same though, so that the gantry is horizontally leveled). By doing so you'll take off the weight from the wheels and it'll be easier to adjust their position. After you're done with adjusting the position of the wheels, tighten up the screws of those metal plates again, drive up the gantry a bit again until the zipties are hanging around freely and then cut them off.

If the bed doesn't stop, turn off your printer. Check the connectors at the switch and the mainboard if they're still in place.

So I'm just listing them without any distinction. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Some users stabilize the rod of the Z-axis by adding a top holder/aligner with a ball bearing in the center which sits on top of the lead screw and mount the holder to the gantry to eliminate wobbling of the lead screw. For doing so, you could print a construction and add a ball bearing, there are different STL files available for this solution.<br> However, as much as it seems useful at first sight, I personally assume that it might be better if the top of the lead screw can move freely to avoid putting extra pressure on the lead screw, the frame and associated parts. If the guidance at the top doesn't allow at least minimal movement, then this could result in shear forces and even in bending the lead screw itself which would cause jamming. </p> </li> <li> <p>Reddit member <a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/DrumsticknDrumstick/ >DrumsticknDrumstick</a> upgraded the z-axis of his <strong>Neo</strong> to a dual drive, the solution fits both the <strong>Go</strong> and the <strong>Neo</strong>: <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/1083sr2/kobra_neogo_dual_z_mod/ >Kobra neo/go dual Z mod</a><br> However, as much as I personally appreciate this mod and like this idea in general, I'm not sure if it really is a good idea as both motors and rods have to work <em>absolutely</em> simulataneously. I once tried a similar mod with my cheap little CNC machine and problems occured as soon as the movement wasn't absolutely identical anymore. However, looking at it at a 3D printer compared to a CNC of similar building architecture, I might be wrong with my concerns as there isn't any pressure applied to the printhead from the bottom side like it is when a router of a CNC machine hits the surface and cuts out material. </p> </li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <a href=# class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8v12Z"/></svg> Back to top </a> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <nav class="md-footer__inner md-grid" aria-label=Footer> <a href=../printhead/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--prev" aria-label="Previous: Printhead" rel=prev> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 11v2H8l5.5 5.5-1.42 1.42L4.16 12l7.92-7.92L13.5 5.5 8 11h12Z"/></svg> </div> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Previous </span> Printhead </div> </div> </a> <a href=../bed/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--next" aria-label="Next: Bed" rel=next> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Next </span> Bed </div> </div> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M4 11v2h12l-5.5 5.5 1.42 1.42L19.84 12l-7.92-7.92L10.5 5.5 16 11H4Z"/></svg> </div> </a> </nav> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy; 2023 Ulf Dieckmann [ 3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de ] | <a href=https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/3d-printer title="3d printer icons">3d printer icon created by Freepik - Flaticon</a> <br> If you find this page useful, please consider recommending it to others.
