The outer diameter of the heatbreak is 7mm at the thick part (top and bottom), at the smaller part between it's 6mm. The inner diameter is about 4.2mm. The length measured from the top until the 'stop ring' before the thread is 15.5mm and the length in total is about 24.6mm. </p> <p><img alt=Hotend src=../../assets/images/head_neo_block-hotend-disass_web.jpg> </p> <p>Additionally there is a little PTFE-tube inside of it, which is about 4cm long and 4mm thick with a 2mm hole inside of it to guide the 1.75mm filament. </p> <p><img alt="Hotend mounted with block and tube" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_block-hotend-tube-used_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>Too high temperatures may harm the PTFE tube - it may become deformed! </li> <li>If you dismounted the hotend and you put it back into the printhead, make sure you check and adjust the position of the ABL sensor and your Z offset afterwards! </li> <li>If you replaced your old hotend with a new one (regardless of whether you also replaced the thermistor and/or cartridge heater with a new one or keep using the existing ones), execute a PID tuning afterwards!</li> </ul> </div> <details class=tip> <summary>Can't Load New Filament?!</summary> <p>If you can't load new filament even though nothing seems to be sticking in there anymore, it's most likely that the little PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged. To clean or replace it you need to disassemble the hotend from the printhead. Scroll down to the "Disassembling" section to find a little guide about how to do that. </p> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Spare Part Hotend</summary> <ul> <li>If you need a new hotend because your heater block or the heatbreak needs to be changed, you can get yourself the spare part hotend for the regular <em>Kobra</em>. If you look at the picture of it and compare it with the ones I've shown above, you'll notice that the shape of the heatbreak is the same. So up to me it'll fit perfectly. </li> <li>If the old thermistor and/or cartridge heater are still good and the wires aren't harmed, you don't have to fiddle around to use the new ones! Just take the existing ones out of the old heater block and install them in the new one. </li> <li>Besides that, the hotend for the <em>Kobra</em> comes with a cartridge heater and a thermistor which are also compatible with the ones from the <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Neo</strong> - at least from a technical side of view. So you'd have them as a spare part also. <br> However, the wires of these parts are way too short though, so you wont't be able to connect them directly! So in case you have to use them, you probably could either just cut the plug and the old part and solder the wires together or (if you have the tools for that) crimp the specific socket for the plug to the old wire to just connect them this way. Polarity doesn't seem to matter here, so just connect the wires. </li> <li><em>Remember to execute a PID tuning after changing the thermistor and/or the cartridge heater!</em> </li> <li>However, scroll down and check out the "Disassembling" section below to see how to dis- and reassemble it. <em>Maybe you don't need new parts, so try to clean up everything first and reassemble it before ordering new parts right away.</em></li> </ul> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Large Clump of Melted Filament Built Up</summary> <p>Sometimes it may happen that melted filament builds up on top of the heater block to a large clump. This actually happened to me the other day (sorry, I forgot to take a picture). The reason for that was that the heatbreak in the heater block became loose somehow and through the little gap it squeezed out. It also may be caused by bad and cheap parts where the thread isn't just as good as it should be. So if you encouter this problem, here is what I recommend to do (based on my experience with this dilemma). </p> <ul> <li>Take off the plastic cover first to get better access to the whole area. </li> <li>Heat up everthing - I did this by using the preherat function for PLA at the control unit.</li> <li>Once the filament starts to melt and gets soft, grab a wooden stick and take away as much as possible carefully. <em>Don't</em> use a screwdriver or something like that to do so as you might harm the wires and/or cause a shortcut at e.g. the contacts of the cartridge heater. <br> <em>Be really careful when taking away the clumps to not harm or rip off any of the wires!</em> You can also use a cloth to wipe off the melted filament from the heater block and so on, just make sure you don't burn yourself! </li> <li>For the next steps you need to be a bit quick in proceeding them, so if this is the first time you're diassembling the hotend, take a look at the sections here at the page and read them first so you'll know where the screws are located and which steps you need to take. Then proceed with the following steps.</li> <li>So, once everything is as clean as possible, turn off the printer and loosen the grub screws inside the heater block to take out the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Give it a quick wipe with the cloth if they're covered by a lot of filament, too (but don't waste too much time here as the filament is becoming hard again now pretty quick!). </li> <li>Then take out the nozzle from the heater block and unscrew the heater block from the hotend. Pay attention if you can feel that the heatbreak was loose in the heater block to check if that was the reason for the filament being able to squeeze out and build up. </li> <li>Dismount the fan on the right side and loosen the two hexagon socket screws which are holding the heatbreak in place. If it doesn't fall out by itself, pull it out. Make sure the little PTFE tube also comes out, take it out of the heatbreak. </li> <li>If you were using a cheap nozzle and have a spare one, just throw away the old one. If it's a good or your only nozzle, try to get it back to work again (I'm sure you'll be able to do so). </li> <li>Now put all the metal parts (heatbreak, heater block and probably the nozzle) in a glass with acetone. close the lid and let it sit there for about 24hrs. The acetone won't dissolve PLA filament or so automagically like it does with ABS, but it'll make it soft and easier to clean. </li> <li>In the meantime you can take care of the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Scratch off the hardened filament from the metal parts by using a cutter for example, but be <em>really</em> careful to not slip off and harm any wires! I personally didn't take care of the little clump at the part where ther wires are coming out of the metal part because I didn't wanted to risk harming the wires, so I just let it sit there. </li> <li>When you're about to clean the meatal parts which soaked in the acetone, I'd recommend wearing disposable gloves as acteone isn't really healthy for your skin. So put on those gloves and start cleaning the parts by carefully scratching off the rest of the filament. Use a cutter, a brass brush etc., but always be careful to not really harm anything. Pay special attention to all the threads and the holes of the heater block where the thermistor and the cartridge heater will take place. If you don't get everything cleaned up at the first time, just put it back in the acetone, wait again and then repeat the cleaning steps. </li> <li>Once everything looks nice and clean, rinse off the acetone with clear water and let it dry. This is especially important for the inner side of the nozzle - you don't want to have acetone in there. </li> <li>Then reassemble everything and put it back in place. Read the notes in the specific sections here about how to reassemble the specific parts and what to pay attention to. </li> <li>At the end when everything is reassembled and you heated up the hotend to finally mount the nozzle and load the filament, extrude filament to see if everything is ok. </li> <li>If so (I hope it will be!), don't start printing right away - execute a PID tuning for the hotend first. </li> <li>Also check if you need to re-level the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle due to a probably different position of the hotend now. -Execute an ABL and take care of your Z-offset as it also might needs to be adjusted because of the same reason: most likely the position of your nozzle will be different due to a different position of the whole hotend. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h2 id=heater-block>Heater Block<a class=headerlink href=#heater-block title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>Both printers use an E3D <strong>V5</strong> compatible heater block.<br> Both the thermistor and the cartidge heater have to be plugged into the specific holes and should be fixed with at tiny grub screw (HEX 1.5). </p> <p><img alt="Heater block V5" src=../../assets/images/head_block-screws-close_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <p>If you need to replace the thermistor and/or the cartridge heater, <em>make sure you don't overtighten the screws as it could harm both the thermistor and the heater cartridge!</em> Note the dent from the screw and the deformed thermistor due to an overtightened screw from the manufacturer at my <strong>Neo</strong>. <br> <img alt="Deformed thermistor due to an overtightened screw" src=../../assets/images/head_therm-cart-broken_web.jpg> </p> </div> <hr> <h2 id=silicone-sock>Silicone Sock<a class=headerlink href=#silicone-sock title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The silicone sock isolates the heater block.

There are compatible V5 silicone socks at the aftermarket which I personally use and which I can highly recommend. They have a bigger lip which slips over the heater block and covers a bigger area of the top than the one which comes with the printer. Therefore they stay in place much better when they heat up and become more flexible.<br> The following pictures show the compatible one from the aftermarket on the left side and the stock sock on the right side. </p> <p><img alt="Silicone socks top view" src=../../assets/images/silisocks_top_web.jpg> </p> <p>Additionaly, they also cover and therefore isolate the base of the nozzle - something that the stock ones don't do at all. </p> <p><img alt="Silicone socks bottom view" src=../../assets/images/silisocks_bottom_web.jpg> </p> <details class=tip> <summary>Tip</summary> <p>If you read the above and still don't know what you should look or search for, search for "silicone sock V5" for example as these socks are for a V5 heater block. You can get them pretty much everywhere, so if you use to shop at Amazon or ebay for example, you'll find many offers which are pretty much the same at the end. <br> Just make sure that you're <strong>not</strong> getting the ones for a V6 heater block! You can also diffenrentiate them by already looking at the shape: the wrong ones for the V6 are more flat on one side, the <em>correct ones</em> for the V5 <em>are cubic</em>, so they are shaped like a dice* as you can see at the pictures above. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=thermistor-cartridge-heater>Thermistor &amp; Cartridge Heater<a class=headerlink href=#thermistor-cartridge-heater title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The <em>thermistor</em> which is used is a capsuled NTC 100k (probably "3950").

I just guided the wires along outside the plastic cover.

The standard size of 0.4mm the printers come with is a good starting point. <br> However, you may find yourself in the situation that you want to print more detailed objects or objects which should be more sturdy or where it doesn't matter if the surface doesn't look as clean and flat as possible, so you probably should adjust the size and switch to a smaller oder bigger diameter like 0.2-0.3mm for detailed objects and 0.6mm for the 'rougher' prints. <br> Keep in mind though that the printing time usually increases by choosing a smaller diameter and it decreases when you're using a bigger diameter due to the smaller/larger layer height that is possible to print. <br> Search the web for more specific informations about finding and choosing the right nozzle size for your project.

It's just not worth it.<br> Remember that the nozzle is pretty much the most crucial part when it comes down to printing and achieving good results, as it's the last link in the chain of the print process and puts out the filament - so go for a manufacturer who is known for quality nozzles. </p> </li> <li> <p>I personally use the E3D V6 brass nozzles (0.6 mm right now) for printing PLA+. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than the super cheap ones, but it's still a good price and it's really worth it - they last longer, they're precisely made and you'll get much better results. As long as you don't want to print special abrasive filaments, you're always good with these standard E3D V6 brass nozzles. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you want to print filaments that are more abrasive, you probably want to go with nozzles made from plated copper, stainless or hardened steel, ruby sapphire nozzles and so on.

So get yourself some good quality nozzles right away so that you can easily replace a nozzle which is too clogged or where the tip may already be harmed.<br> A harmed tip may also cause artefacts like stringing for example, so also keep that in mind if you suddenly see yourself confronted with weird and unexplainable printing behavior (in terms of quality). </p> <details class=example> <summary>Cleaning the Nozzle</summary> <ul> <li>For cleaning the nozzle and getting rid of excessive filament during the printing process or right before printing starts as the extruder is heating up, just use a long and thin wooden stick like a skewer. A wooden toothpick also works fine - just make sure you don't burn yourself as it may be a bit short. </li> <li>Before and after each print I recommend to wipe away the melted filament at the nozzle with a paper towel or a cloth - but <em>don't burn yourself!</em> This procedure keeps the nozzle clean and the rest of the filament won't burn black onto the brass which makes it hard to remove later. </li> <li>If the nozzle is already too smeared and has too much filament burnt onto the surface to be cleaned with a paper towel, you can use a small brass brush. Be careful though to not harm the tip of the nozzle by scrubbing too hard across it! Be careful to <em>not</em> touch any wires or contacts during brushing at it may cause a shortcut and blow off your mainboard! So I'd suggest you heat up the nozzle and then turn off the printer before starting to brush. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged, using a needle with the correct diameter to stick it into the hot nozzle for cleaning it sometimes works. Just stick in in the heatened up nozzle and poke around. Be careful to not harm the tip of the nozzle though! </li> <li>You can also use certain filament which is made for cleaning. You load it and let it run through. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged and therefore the cleaning filament can't run through, you could also try to do a "cold pull". To do so you load the cleaning filament and manually push it into a bit. Then let the nozzle cool down and rip out the filament. You may have to repeat this procedure a few times until the cleaning filament can run through again. However, be careful not to rip off the filament by doing the cold pull as you then definitely have to disassemble the hotend. </li> <li>If you still encounter problems with the flow of the filament though or if you even can't load new filament, most likely the little PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak is clogged. Scroll down to the "Disassembling" section where you'll find a little guide about how to get it out and clean it. </li> <li>If you took out the nozzle from the heater block and can't get it clean, try to put in acetone and let it sit there - the longer the better (I'd say minimum 24hrs). This method works especially great with ABS as that just dissolves, but it also works at least a bit with other types of filament like PLA (although not as good as with ABS at all) and makes it a bit softer. Then you can try to poke the filament out. This also works with the heater block and the heatbreak if you want to clean them also. Make sure to rinse them with water before installing though. </li> </ul> </details> <h3 id=changing-the-nozzle>Changing the Nozzle<a class=headerlink href=#changing-the-nozzle title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If you need to change the nozzle, mind the warnings from above and check out the following steps in the expandable block below.</p> <details class=example> <summary>Changing the Nozzle</summary> <ul> <li>If you just want to change the nozzle, take off the silicone sock of the heater block, then <em>heat up the extruder first</em> about 5-10°C above your regular printing temperature and pull back the filament a bit once it's warm enough. </li> <li>Once the extruder heated up, let it sit at that temperature for about a minute or two to make sure that even the last amount of filament which might stick somewhere in the gaps or the thread is melted. </li> <li>Then <em>turn off the printer</em> and ideally unplug it from the power outlet. Don't fiddle around while it's turned on - in case you slip with the wrench and harm the wires you could create a shortcut which most likely will blow something up of your mainboard. </li> <li>Then grab the heater block with a wrench to hold it in place and screw out the nozzle carefully. Use a sufficient tool like a wrench or a socket wrench for the nozzle - don't use a pair of pliers as it may/will round off the screw nut. </li> <li>Make sure you don't turn the heater block at all to not loosen it from the heat break! Just hold it in place.</li> <li>If the nozzle won't come loose, heat up the extruder again, raise the temperature a bit and let it sit longer to melt the filament in the gaps which seems to block. Before trying to unscrew the nozzle, switch off the printer again. <br> If that still doesn't work, you could take a piece of damp cloth and hold it against the nozzle (<em>not</em> the heater block, <em>only the nozzle</em>!) for a moment to cool it down. Due to the sudden decrease of temperature the metal of the nozzle will contract a tiny bit which may result in being able to unscrew it. </li> <li>For installing the new nozzle, screw it in and turn it back about one rotation once you feel it hits the hotend. I personally do this after everything cooled down until it's safe to touch because then I can screw in the nozzle by hand and therefore I can feel right at the start if it doesn't sit correctly. </li> <li>Check if you didn't harm any wires! </li> <li>If everything is fine, power up the printer, heat up the extruder again and carefully tighten up the nozzle (don't overtighten it though). </li> <li> <p>Don't get irritated by the fact that there's a little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block - that's totally fine and it's supposed to be like that as the following picture shows. <br> <img alt="Mounted nozzle" src=../../assets/images/head_nozzle-mounted_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Never try to unscrew the nozzle from the heater block while the parts are cold!</em></strong> <br> Melted filament or some kind of screw lock glue will make it hard or even impossible to unscrew it and you risk to shear off the nozzle! </li> <li>Make sure you're holding the heater block tight to avoid <em>any</em> movement and don't overtighten the nozzle!

The following steps are just a rough guide through so that you know what you'll be confrontated with. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>If you need to disassemble the printhead for e.g. changing the hotend, <em>unload the filament first!</em> </li> <li>For changing the nozzle or disassembling the heatbreak from the heater block, you have to <em>heat up the parts first!</em> <br> The main reason for that is to melt the filament which most likely entered little gaps there. Usually it's said that it should be around 200°C but that's probably not sufficient because (in my opinion) it depends on the material of the filament. So my suggestion is to heat up the extruder about 5-10°C more than the temperature you're printing with, then you should be on the safe side. <br> So either do that using the pre-heat function of the printer or by using a sufficient heat gut. However - don't burn yourself by touching the hot metal parts!</li> <li>Before starting to tinker <em>turn off the printer</em> and <em>unplug it from the power outlet!</em></li> <li><em>Use the sufficient tools!</em> <br> So please don't try to loosen the nozzle with a pair of pliers for example, use e.g. a wrench for that. <br> I also strongly recommend to <em>not</em> use a pair of pliers for the heater block, also for that you should use a wrench (if you don't have one of that size, use an adjustable one). A wrench has a smooth surface and therefore won't scratch the surface or even put dents into the block. </li> <li>Make sure you <em>don't lose a screw</em> and make sure you'll <em>know where the screws belong</em> later when you want to reassemble everything again. <br> You might will be able to remember the belonging screws and positions if your tinkering lasts only an hour, but if anything crosses your plan and therefore you have to pause tinkering, you maybe won't remember one week later. So maybe start sorting the screws and take notes where they belong and/or take pictures right away from the start.</li> <li><em>Be patient and careful.</em> Generally speaking, if you unscrew something and it doesn't come off easy, don't start pulling too hard as you might have overseen a screw or clip, so better watch twice. </li> <li><em>Don't harm or rip off any wires</em> as it may cause severe damage to your mainboard or might be complicated to fix later on. </li> </ul> </div> <hr> <h3 id=go_4>Go<a class=headerlink href=#go_4 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <h4 id=take-off-the-plastic-cover>Take Off the Plastic Cover<a class=headerlink href=#take-off-the-plastic-cover title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>Whatever you want to do, like if you want to change the hotend, the heater block, the heatbreak, a fan or even want to disassemble the whole feeder system, you have to remove the plastic cover of the printhead first.<br> It's secured by two hexagon socket screws at the top of the metal back plate and a plastic clip at each side at the lower bottom.

Then lower the head to make the nozzle touch the sheet of paper. You should still be able to move the paper but you should feel a minimum amount of resistance as a sign that the nozzle is touching it. <br> Then place the wrench under the ABL sensor and ajust the height of it by turning the screw on top so that the sensor touches the surface of the wrench. </li> <li>After completing the beforementioned steps, take the parts away from the bed, set your Z offset to zero (0) if you didn't do it yet and home all axes.

Be aware that there is something like a tiny thread on the little plastic lip located towards the lower end of this lid of the bracket (see red mark on the picture to the right) - make sure this thread fits into the thread of the sensor. If everything sits just right you don't need much pressure to close the lid, so be aware and careful here to not break anything. <br> <img alt="ABL sensor disassembled" src=../../assets/images/ABL_sensor-dissambled_web.jpg> </li> <li>After reassembling the sensor, make sure to level it (see expandable box above).</li> </ul> </details> <h4 id=disassembling-the-feeder-system>Disassembling the Feeder System<a class=headerlink href=#disassembling-the-feeder-system title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>If you need to disassemble the feeder system, check out the following steps in the expandable box below. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Disassembling the Feeder System</summary> <ul> <li>I didn't disassemble the feeder system yet, so I can't really provide any specific steps or further pictures of the disassembling the feeder system itself.

Now you should be able to remove your lost part with some tweezers or get a closer look at the gears if anything is damaged. </li> <li>From what I've seen looking at the printhead while the plastic cover is taken off, you probably would have to disassemble the motor from the system if you want to go even further from here, but I can't really say anything about that right now.</li> </ul> </details> <h4 id=reassembling_1>Reassembling<a class=headerlink href=#reassembling_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>For reassembling, just proceed the steps you took to disassemble the part in reverse. However, you might also want to have a look at the general steps I mentioned in the expandable box below. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>If you dismounted the hotend and/or the ABL sensor, make sure to level the ABL sensor again and control your Z offset!</li> <li>If you replaced the hotend/heater block and/or changed the thermistor and/or the cartridge heater, execute a PID tuning!</li> </ul> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Reassembling</summary> <p>For reassembling, just put everything back together by reverting the beforementioned steps. Make sure you're using the right screws and don't forget any of them. Don't overtighten the screws - as my father (R.I.P.) used to say: "After tight comes loose!" (roughly translated). </p> <ol> <li>Warm up the parts using e.g. a heat gun and screw the heatbreak into the heater block until it sits tight. </li> <li>Put back the cleaned or renewed PTFE tube. </li> <li>Put the thermistor and the heater cartridge back in place and secure them by <em>carefully</em> tighten the tiny hex screw - <em>don't overtighten them as you could harm the thermistor and the heater cartridge!</em> </li> <li>Then push the heatbreak back into the specific hole - make sure you push it deep enough (I personally push it as far into it as it goes). </li> <li>Turn the hotend so that the wires which are coming from the heater block are hanging freely and aren't bent too much. </li> <li>Then tighten up the screws, so that the hotend doesn't turn or wiggle anymore (but don't overtighten the screws though). </li> <li>Reassemble the fan and the plastic cover. </li> </ol> </details> <hr> <h2 id=mods>Mods<a class=headerlink href=#mods title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>In the following I'll list some mods I found which belong to the part "printhead" somehow.
